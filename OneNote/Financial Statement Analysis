You are a Data Scientist working for a consulting firm. One of your colleagues from the auditing department has asked you to help them assess the financial statement of organization X

You have been supplied with two vectors of data: monthly revenue and monthly expenses for the financial year in question. You task is to calculate the following financial metrics:

	- Profit for each month
	- Profit after tax for each month (tax rate is 30%)
	- Profit margin for each month - equals to profit after tax divided by revenue
	- Good months - where the profit after tax was higher than mean
	- Bad months - where the profit after tax was less than mean
	- The best month - where the profit after tax was max for the year
	- The worst month - where the profit after tax was min for the year
All results need to presented as vectors

Result for dollar value needs to be calculated with $0.01 precision, but need to be presented in units of $1000 with no decimal points.

Results for the profit margin ratio need to be presented in units of % with no decimal point.

Note : Your colleague has warned you that it is okay for tax for any given month to be negative( in accounting terms, negative tax translated into a deferred tax asset)
