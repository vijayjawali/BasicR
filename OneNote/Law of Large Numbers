Test the Law of Large numbers for N Random normally distributed numbers with mean = 0, stdev = 1;
Create an R script that will count how many of these numbers fall between -1 and 1 and divide by total quantity of N
You know that E(X) = 68.2%
Check that Mean (XN) = E(X) as you rerun your script while increasing N

Rscript
N <- 100
counter <- 0
for(i in rnorm(N)){
  if(i >= -1 & i <= 1){
    counter <- counter + 1
  }
}
answer <- counter / N
answer
